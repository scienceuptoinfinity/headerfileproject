The `lab.h` header file defines a class `g` for manipulating monomial functions, which are functions of the form f(x) = ax^n.
The `g` class has several constructors that allow you to create monomial functions with different parameter combinations. For example, you can create a monomial function with parameters a, x, and n using the constructor `g (char p[], char q[], char r[])`.
The `g` class also provides a method `der for computing the derivative of a monomial function. The derivative of f(x) = ax^n is given by f'(x) = anx^(n-1).
 The `diff` method of the `g` class implements the differentiation formula and stores the result in a character array `D`. The `D` array can be accessed using the `der method to get the derivative of the monomial function.
The lab.h` header file defines a preprocessor directive `__LAB_H` to prevent multiple inclusion of the header file in a single compilation unit.
The implementation of the `g` class uses various C++ language features such as constructors, copy constructors, protected members, and integer to character conversion using the `itoa function from the standard library.
The code was written by Sumit Nirmal and Raj Krishna under the guidance of Mr. Gaurav Tripathi.
